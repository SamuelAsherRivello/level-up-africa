PRODUCTION NOTES


##STARTING POINT

There are 2 versions of the RollABall game


## ENDING POINT

We want 3 versions of the RollABall game.


## TODO

1. SamR suggests to copy from #2 "Example02_Game_Complete_MiniMvcs_NonDots" be copied and renamed as #3 "Example03_Game_Complete_MiniMvcs_Dots". That's a great starting point for making your new version of the game.

2. As always, when copying folders, #3 is going to have MANY files (e.g. prefabs) that point to #2. There are many ways to fix that.

3. So I suggests to delete #2, fix #3, then undelete #2. Use git along the way to mimic "delete" and "undelete".
